**Introduction:**

Crystalline solids have ordered 3D dimension arrangement of atoms, ions, molecules. These arrangements are called crystal structures and are formed as a result of properties of the particles. Crystal structures have an influence on properties such as the transparency of the material and density. 

The unit cell is the most basic repeating unit of the crystal structure. The unit cell is represented as a box containing one or more atoms arranged in 3D space, below is an example of a unit cell

**Questions:**

*Using the VR Periodic Table and a google cardboard try to identify which element has the above unit cell?*
 
*Look at the elements Lithium and Beryllium which element do you think is more dense? Why?*

*There are 7 diatomic elements, diatomic means consisting of two atoms. Identify 4 of the elements using the app.*
